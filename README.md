# News Platform

## Overview

News Platform is a simple, modern news application that allows users to view news articles. The platform consists of a backend server built with Node.js and Express, a MongoDB database for storing articles, and a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- View news articles with titles, content, and publication dates.
- Simple and responsive design with a clean user interface.
- API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting articles.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js and npm** - Install from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **MongoDB** - Install from [MongoDB official site](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) or use a cloud service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-platform.git
   cd news-platform
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup MongoDB:**

   Ensure MongoDB is running on your local machine:

   ```bash
   mongod
   ```

   Alternatively, configure your `server.js` file to connect to a cloud MongoDB instance.

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend Server:**

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   This will start the Express server on `http://localhost:5000`.

2. **Access the Frontend:**

   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`. You should see the news platform homepage with a list of articles.
